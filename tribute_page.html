            <h2>The domestic dog</h2>
            <p>The domestic dog is a member of the genus Canis (canines), 
            which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most
            widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog was the first 
            species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over 
            millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and 
            physical attributes.</p>
            <h3>Intelligence, behavior and communication</h3>
            <h4>Intelligence</h4>
            <p>Dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information 
            and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems. Dogs have 
            been shown to learn by inference. Dogs have advanced memory skills.
            A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border 
            collie, "Chaser", who had learned the names and could associate by 
            verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs are able to read and react 
            appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, 
            and to understand human voice commands. Modern domestic dogs use 
            humans to solve their problems for them.</p>
            <h4>Behavior</h4>
            <p>As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from
            9,000â€“30,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped 
            by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and 
            social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the 
            ability to understand and communicate with humans, and they are uniquely 
            attuned to human behaviors. Behavioral scientists have uncovered a 
            surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the domestic dog. These 
            abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives nor by 
            other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel 
            some of the social-cognitive skills of human children.</p>
            <h4>Communication</h4>
            <p>Dog communication is about how dogs "speak" to each other, how they
            understand messages that humans send to them, and how humans can 
            translate the ideas that dogs are trying to transmit. These 
            communication behaviors include eye gaze, facial expression, 
            vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs) 
            and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones and taste). Humans 
            communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals and body 
            posture.</p>
            <h3>Roles with humans</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hunting</li>
                <li>Herding</li>
                <li>Pulling loads</li>
                <li>Protection</li>
                <li>Assisting police</li>
                <li>Military</li>
                <li>Companionship</li>
                <li>Aiding handicapped individuals</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This influence on human society has given them the nickname "man's best 
            friend" in the Western world.</p>
